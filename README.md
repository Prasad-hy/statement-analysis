The Statement Analysis repository is an end-to-end machine learning project focused on applying and comparing various classification algorithms to analyze textual statements. Its primary goal is to determine patterns, sentiment, intent, and overall meaning behind written text by leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).

This repository provides a structured workflow for text preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The text data undergoes cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization, and transformation into numerical features using techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings.

Multiple classification models are implemented and benchmarked to ensure comprehensive performance comparison, including:

Logistic Regression

Naïve Bayes Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree and Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Gradient Boosting and XGBoost

Deep Learning models (optional) using LSTM or BERT

The repository is designed for researchers, data enthusiasts, and developers interested in exploring how different algorithms perform on text-based classification tasks. Each model is trained and evaluated using consistent metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to identify the best-performing approach.

In addition, the project includes visualization tools to display sentiment distribution, feature importance, and model comparison results.

Use cases include sentiment analysis, opinion mining, review classification, survey response analysis, and behavioral text interpretation. The modular design allows easy integration with new datasets or machine learning models for future experiments.
